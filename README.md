This is an old tool created around 2012 to help students practice number sense tricks. The code has not been updated since, but was uploaded for reference and archiving purposes. The following content used to be live on a self-hosted website.

# Welcome to Numsense.com
This website will provide information on various number sense tricks along with applets that will help you practice and guide you through every step of the problem.

## Here are the applets that I have so far:
* [Multiplying two-digit numbers](2digitmulti2.html)
* [Multiplying numbers close to, but greater than, 100](nct100bg.html)
* [Multiplying numbers close to, but less than, 100](nct100bl.html)

# Numsense
Website created around 2012 to help students practice number sense tricks. The code has not been updated since, but was uploaded to GitHub simply for reference. The code written definitely **does not** represent good coding practices. Besides small changes to the text, the content below used to be live on a self-hosted website.

## Applets I have so far:
* [Multiplying two-digit numbers](2digitmulti2.html)
* [Multiplying numbers close to, but greater than, 100](nct100bg.html)
* [Multiplying numbers close to, but less than, 100](nct100bl.html)
* [Multiplying by eleven](multi11.html)
